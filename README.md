# Mixpanel Alerts

Mixpanel is a basic Rails 5 application that lets you create alerts based on thresholds in your data.

Eventually, this application will let you create an alert based on...

* Event volume

* Conversion rate

* % change in an event

...and deliver an email message to your inbox to notify you of the change.


**This application is in no way endorsed by Mixpanel, Inc.**
